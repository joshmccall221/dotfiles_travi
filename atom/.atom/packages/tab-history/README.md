# Tab History

Tab History overrides the default 'pane:prev-item' and 'pane:next-item' shortcuts
to allow switching tabs according to most recent usage.

## Limitations

The current version only support ctrl as the main modifier key.
This plugin will not behave well with shortcuts not using ctrl as a modifier key.

## Todo

  - Display the list of most recent tabs when switching to allow faster navigation.

  - Handle different main modifier keys (alt/shift/mac commands?) by
    parsing the keybindings.
